<h2>About LightLang</h2>
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>LightLang</strong> - is a set of language programs for <strong>Linux</strong>. Its main part is the system of electronic dictionaries. It consists of several programs - <strong>SL</strong> (the search kernel), <strong>XSL</strong> (the program's graphical interface written with the use of <strong>Qt4</strong>), <strong>LLRepo</strong> (the utility for working with <strong>LightLang</strong> repositories).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional packages expand the program's functionality, adding, for example, a possibility to hear the pronunciation of a word.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is set up in such a manner that you do not have to use the <strong>SL</strong> graphical interface, and invoke the search kernel directly from the command line instead. It is very convenient when using systems without the <strong>X</strong>-server.
