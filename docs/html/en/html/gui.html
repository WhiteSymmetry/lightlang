<h2>Using graphical interface XSL</h2>
<hr>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to use the graphical interface becomes clear immediately after it has been launched, that is why this section describes only certain specifics and correspondence between the console options of <strong>SL</strong> and its graphical interface components.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Specific features of the <strong>XSL</strong> graphical interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Words beginning with letters typed in will be displayed as you type;</li>
  <li>Each word in the list is a link that you can click on to see the translation of the word;</li>
  <li>Pressing <em>Enter</em> invokes the usual search for a word;</li>
  <li>After the search has been completed, you can hear the pronunciation (if transcription is available) by pressing <em>Ctrl+S</em>;</li>
  <li>Every word can be opened in a separate tab; tabs are independent and the contents in one tab do not affect the contents of another tab;</li>
</ul>
<br>

<table border=1>
  <caption><h4>Correspondence between the command-line options and the graphical interface components</h4></caption>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>-u</em></td>
      <td><em>[Search]</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>-l</em></td>
      <td><em>Automatic or [Word list]</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>-c</em></td>
      <td><em>[Expanded search]</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>-i</em></td>
      <td><em>[Similar words]</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Additional features</h3>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>XSL</strong> contains the <strong>Spy</strong> service, which executes a search by the highlighted word. After the service has been launched, use the mouse cursor to select a word, in any window, and you will see its translation. You can open the <strong>XSL</strong> main window and edit the search request.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>XSL</strong> also creates a tray icon and is able to hide in it. The Icons menu contains the <strong>Spy</strong> controls, which allows to use that service without expanding the program's main window.
